# fibonacci_sequence

Function takes a "maximum" value and generates a list of all numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence up to the maximum number.  I wasn't quite following some of the coding examples on this that are online so I decided to do it in a way that made sense to me so that I understood every step of what was occuring in the code.

### To-Do
* I don't see a reason that the sequence list needs to be a global variable, can be moved inside the function.
* Documentation
